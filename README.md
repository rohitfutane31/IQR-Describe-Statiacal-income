Descriptive Statistics with Python Project
Descriptive Statistics is the subject matter of this project. Descriptive statistics gives us the basic summary measures about the dataset. The summary measures include measures of central tendency (mean, median and mode) and measures of variability (variance, standard deviation, minimum/maximum values, IQR (Interquartile Range), skewness and kurtosis). I have used the fortune 500 dataset from the data world website for this project.

Results and conclusion
1. Introduction to descriptive statistics
Descriptive statistics are numbers that are used to describe and summarize the data. They are used to describe the basic features of the data under consideration. They provide simple summary measures which give an overview of the dataset. Summary measures that are commonly used to describe a data set are measures of central tendency and measures of variability or dispersion.

Measures of central tendency include the mean, median and mode. These measures summarize a given data set by providing a single data point. These measures describe the center position of a distribution for a data set. We analyze the frequency of each data point in the distribution and describes it using the mean, median or mode. They provide the average of a data set. They can be either a representation of entire population or a sample of the population.

Measures of variability or dispersion include the variance or standard deviation, coefficient of variation, minimum and maximum values, IQR (Interquartile Range), skewness and kurtosis`. These measures help us to analyze how spread-out the distribution is for a dataset. So, they provide the shape of the data set.

2. Measures of central tendency
Central tendency means a central value which describe a probability distribution. It may also be called a center or location of the distribution. The most common measures of central tendency are mean, median and mode. The most common measure of central tendency is the mean. For skewed distribution or when there is concern about outliers, the median may be preferred. So, median is more robust measure than the mean.

Mean
The most common measure of central tendency is the mean.
Mean is also known as the simple average.
It is denoted by greek letter µ for population and by ¯x for sample.
We can find mean of a number of elements by adding all the elements in a dataset and then dividing by the number of elements in the dataset.
It is the most common measure of central tendency but it has a drawback.
The mean is affected by the presence of outliers.
So, mean alone is not enough for making business decisions.
Median
Median is the number which divides the dataset into two equal halves.
To calculate the median, we have to arrange our dataset of n numbers in ascending order.
The median of this dataset is the number at (n+1)/2 th position, if n is odd.
If n is even, then the median is the average of the (n/2)th number and (n+2)/2 th number.
Median is robust to outliers.
So, for skewed distribution or when there is concern about outliers, the median may be preferred.
Mode
Mode of a dataset is the value that occurs most often in the dataset.
Mode is the value that has the highest frequency of occurrence in the dataset.
There is no best measure that give us the complete picture. So, these measures of central tendency (mean, median and mode) should be used together to represent the full picture.

3. Measures of dispersion or variability
Dispersion is an indicator of how far away from the center, we can find the data values. The most common measures of dispersion are variance, standard deviation and interquartile range (IQR). Variance is the standard measure of spread. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. The variance and standard deviation are two useful measures of spread.

Variance
Variance measures the dispersion of a set of data points around their mean value.
It is the mean of the squares of the individual deviations.
Variance gives results in the original units squared.
Standard deviation
Standard deviation is the most common used measure of variability.
It is the square-root of the variance.
For Normally distributed data, approximately 95% of the values lie within 2 s.d. of the mean.
Standard deviation gives results in the original units.
Coefficient of Variation (CV)
Coefficient of Variation (CV) is equal to the standard deviation divided by the mean.
It is also known as relative standard deviation.
IQR (Interquartile range)
A third measure of spread is the interquartile range (IQR).
The IQR is calculated using the boundaries of data situated between the 1st and the 3rd quartiles.
The interquartile range (IQR) can be calculated as follows:- IQR = Q3 – Q1
In the same way that the median is more robust than the mean, the IQR is a more robust measure of spread than variance and standard deviation and should therefore be preferred for small or asymmetrical distributions.
It is a robust measure of spread.
Measures of shape
Now, we will take a look at measures of shape of distribution. There are two statistical measures that can tell us about the shape of the distribution. These measures are skewness and kurtosis. These measures can be used to convey information about the shape of the distribution of the dataset.

Skewness
Skewness is a measure of a distribution's symmetry or more precisely lack of symmetry.
It is used to mean the absence of symmetry from the mean of the dataset.
It is a characteristic of the deviation from the mean.
It is used to indicate the shape of the distribution of data.
Negative skewness
Negative values for skewness indicate negative skewness.
In this case, the data are skewed or tail to left.
By skewed left, we mean that the left tail is long relative to the right tail.
The data values may extend further to the left but concentrated in the right.
So, there is a long tail and distortion is caused by extremely small values which pull the mean downward so that it is less than the median.
Hence, in this case we have Mean < Median < Mode
Zero skewness
Zero skewness means skewness value of zero.
It means the dataset is symmetrical.
A data set is symmetrical if it looks the same to the left and right to the center point.
The dataset looks bell shaped or symmetrical.
A perfectly symmetrical data set will have a skewness of zero.
So, the normal distribution which is perfectly symmetrical has a skewness of 0.
So, in this case, we have Mean = Median = Mode
Positive skewness
Positive values for skewness indicate positive skewness.
The dataset are skewed or tail to right.
By skewed right, we mean that the right tail is long relative to the left tail.
The data values are concentrated in the right.
So, there is a long tail to the right that is caused by extremely large values which pull the mean upward so that it is greater than the median.
So, we have Mean > Median > Mode
Reference range on skewness values
The rule of thumb for skewness values are:

If the skewness is between -0.5 and 0.5, the data are fairly symmetrical.
If the skewness is between -1 and – 0.5 or between 0.5 and 1, the data are moderately skewed.
If the skewness is less than -1 or greater than 1, the data are highly skewed.
Kurtosis
Kurtosis is the degree of peakedness of a distribution.
Data sets with high kurtosis tend to have a distinct peak near the mean, decline rather rapidly and have heavy tails.
Data sets with low kurtosis tend to have a flat top near the mean rather than a sharp peak.
Reference range for kurtosis
The reference standard is a normal distribution, which has a kurtosis of 3.
Often, excess kurtosis is presented instead of kurtosis, where excess kurtosis is simply kurtosis - 3.
Mesokurtic curve
A normal distribution has kurtosis exactly 3 (excess kurtosis exactly 0).
Any distribution with kurtosis ≈3 (excess ≈ 0) is called mesokurtic.
Platykurtic curve
A distribution with kurtosis < 3 (excess kurtosis < 0) is called platykurtic.
As compared to a normal distribution, its central peak is lower and broader, and its tails are shorter and thinner.
Leptokurtic curve
A distribution with kurtosis > 3 (excess kurtosis > 0) is called leptokurtic.
As compared to a normal distribution, its central peak is higher and sharper, and its tails are longer and fatter.
Summary
So far, we have looked at the measures of central tendency of the data which include mean, median and mode. Also, we have taken a look at measures of spread of the data which consists of variance, standard deviation, interquartile range (IQR), minimum and maximum values. We have also discussed skewness and kurtosis as measures of shape. These quantities can only be used for quantitative variables not for categorical variables.
